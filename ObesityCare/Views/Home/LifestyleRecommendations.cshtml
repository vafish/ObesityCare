                        <br />
                        According to the <a href="https://www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au/health/HealthyLiving/overweight-children-healthy-lifestyle-tips">Better Health Channel(2013)</a>, children become overweight when the energy they ‘take in' (via food and drink) exceeds the energy they ‘put out' (through physical activity and exercise). Weight loss can occur when your child consumes less calories than you burn per day (this magic number is provided by our calculator on the website).
                        In essence, there are two ways to stay fit: diet management and exercise.
                        At this age, children have their own opinions. They do, however, need parental assistance. Now is the time to provide your child with the resources and lessons they will need to make healthier decisions in their lives. The following tools can be useful:

                        <br />
                        Stock your pantry with nutritious foods. If you simply declare no treats, it will not work. According to research, restricting foods can make your child crave them even more (<a href="https://www.webmd.com/parenting/raising-fit-kids/weight/features/weight-loss-recommendations">Liao, 2017</a>). Through keeping fast food out of the house and replacing them with healthier one, you will be assisting them in making healthy choices. Use our food comparison and swapping tool to compare different common foods that we see every day, measure the calorie quantities, swap with more nutritious foods, and award points based on the difference in calorie intake to your children.

                        Encourage your child to move around and play. Children of this age need a lot of exercise. This may include riding their bike, swimming, playing basketball, or even assisting you with your gardening. Use our popular exercise searcher to calculate how many calories your child burns during a given exercise and record it to see if he is achieving the target of the "magic number" provided by our calculators.

                        Bring the rest of the family along. Rather than singling out your kids, try playing with them. Using our typical playground games activity searcher, you will find an activity that your child enjoys, is easily accessible, is reasonably priced, and suits your child's age and ability level. You can learn the rules and even discover exciting new games that your child would enjoy.
