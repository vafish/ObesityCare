                        According to the <a href="https://www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au/health/HealthyLiving/overweight-children-healthy-lifestyle-tips">Better Health Channel(2013)</a>, children become overweight when the energy they ‘take in' (via food and drink) exceeds the energy they ‘put out' (through physical activity and exercise). Weight loss can occur when your child consumes less calories than you burn per day (this magic number is provided by our calculator on the website).
                        In essence, there are two ways to stay fit: diet management and exercise.
                        At this age, children have their own opinions. They do, however, need parental assistance. Now is the time to provide your child with the resources and lessons they will need to make healthier decisions in their lives. The following tools can be useful:

                        <br />
                        Learn about how the total daily energy expenditure (TDEE) figure is critical to your child's health and portion sizes with each meal preparation, look at the most popular foods that affect obesity and the recommended daily intakes provided by global organizations, and try a small game on preparing a child's lunch box to get an idea of what it is like for your child to live a healthy lifestyle.

                        <br />
                        Use our food searcher to look up the calorie counts of some of the most popular foods found in the home; keep in mind that the key to losing weight is to eat no more than the measured TDEE number. Try to actively plan, preserve, and monitor your child's calorie intake. Remember to keep our lunch box game's portion sizes and concept of a healthy lunch box in mind.

                        Encourage your child to move around and play. Children of this age need a lot of exercise. This may include riding their bike, swimming, playing basketball, or even assisting you with your gardening. Use our popular exercise searcher to calculate how many calories your child burns during a given exercise and record it to see if he is achieving the target of the "magic number" provided by our calculators.
