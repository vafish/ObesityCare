                        According to the <a href="https://www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au/health/HealthyLiving/overweight-children-healthy-lifestyle-tips">Better Health Channel(2013)</a>, children become overweight when the energy they ‘take in' (via food and drink) exceeds the energy they ‘put out' (through physical activity and exercise). Weight loss can occur when your child consumes less calories than you burn per day (this magic number is provided by our calculator on the website).
                        In essence, there are two ways to stay fit: diet management and exercise.
                        At this age, children have their own opinions. They do, however, need parental assistance. Now is the time to provide your child with the resources and lessons they will need to make healthier decisions in their lives. The following tools can be useful:

                        Encourage your child to move around and play. Children of this age need a lot of exercise. This may include riding their bike, swimming, playing basketball, or even assisting you with your gardening. Use our popular exercise searcher to calculate how many calories your child burns during a given exercise and record it to see if he is achieving the target of the "magic number" provided by our calculators.

                        Bring the rest of the family along. Rather than singling out your kids, try playing with them. Using our typical playground games activity searcher, you will find an activity that your child enjoys, is easily accessible, is reasonably priced, and suits your child's age and ability level. You can learn the rules and even discover exciting new games that your child would enjoy.
